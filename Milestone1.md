## Update

Identify what steps you have done, and upload any/all scripts. Within a subdirectory called scripts, please include all scripts that will be used. 
It is ok to initially use Excel, however all filtering of files must be done in R by the end.  As much as possible, it should be fully reproducible from R/Command-line with the exception of selection and downloading files.
Please use a shell script to move or do anything with files to ensure reproducibility. 
For example, if you used a shell script to download files, please include that.
Make code reproducible as possible:
Please use relative paths (~/myproject), not absolute paths (/home/davidcraig/myproject). 
If helpful, please take a picture of your status, and make it visible within the Gitub in line. 
 simply append ?raw=true to the image url will make the trick:

 ![](images/mypciture.png?raw=true)

 If you are doing R, this picture would show where you are in vignette and show the variables, etc.
 
 ## Next Steps

 What steps are you going to do for milestone 2. This ,may be just a repeat of previously.
 
##  Data
 
 Not due by Milestone 1, but I'll address.
 Your github will not hold your data. Please put your data in a shared GoogleDrive folder as a tar/zip file called finalproject.tar.gz which upon untaring with tar -xvzf finalproject.tar.gz will create a folder called data that contains all your data in a way that your script can operate off of.  This section will create a link that shared dataset.
 
##  Known Issues. 

 You will have modifications and things you did that didn't work.  Anything that you were not able to address yet or plan to address should be in a specific section called 'known issues'.
 If you are having any problems or need a time extension. Address this as a known issue and just modify your next steps. As long as you document this by end of day on Thursday, you will recieve credit.
