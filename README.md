## Overview of project

I will study differentially expressed genes between two groups. One group of people is younger than 65 years old, while the other group is older than 65 years old. This analysis will utilize the package DESeq2 and follow the specific vignette: 
[link](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)

For this analysis, I will use the TCGA cohort and have identidfied 20 RNA-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 10 samples from the first group and 10 from the other group.
Data
I will use the data from [ICGC](https://dcc.icgc.org/.) Examining clinical data, there are 20 cases, and each group has 10 samples.

## Milestone 1

I will randomly select 20 samples from total 369 cases to build up my first dataset. Then, the dataset will be downloaded and be arranged for further analyzing. I would analysis the gene expression pattern by making a plot like Heatmap plot. 

## Milestone 2

An initial completion of vignette. I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette. Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback. Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.

## Deliverable

A complete repository with clear documentation and description of my analysis and results.
