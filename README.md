## Overview of project

I will study differentially expressed genes between two groups. One group of people is younger than 65 years old, while the other group is older than 65 years old. This analysis will utilize the package DESeq2 and follow the specific vignette: 
[link](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)

For this analysis, I will use the TCGA cohort and have identidfied 331 RNA-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort.Saperated by the age of 65 years old,128 samples are from the group beyond 65 years old and 203 samples are from the group under 65 years old.

## Data
I will use the data from [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) Examining clinical data, there are total 331 cases from 55 to 75 years old, and each group has 128 and 203 samples .

## Milestone 1

I will download total 331 cases to build up my first dataset. Then, the dataset will be arranged for further analyzing. I'll analysis the gene expression pattern by making a plot like Heatmap plot or PCA plot. 

## Milestone 2

An initial completion of vignette. I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette. Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback. Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.

## Deliverable

A complete repository with clear documentation and description of my analysis and results.
