## Update 

### Modified my Milestone_1

I modified my Milestone_1 with more details about how to download the data step by step. Then, I reloaded the data and put more screenshots to follow through.

### Input all samples

After testing with more files, now I will start putting all my samples in my "all" folder and going through the script that I previously made.

## Differential expression analysis

## Data

All of my data will be uploaded to my GitHub acount.

## Feedback

Change all my ensembl id to real gene names.

See how many genes are significantly different (up-regulated or down-regulated).

Try to get no more than 500 genes.

Look into the link Dr. Craig gave us to look into the biology part(put in the gene list I have).

Heatmaps need to be fixed.

## Known issues

I will change my p-value to 0.05 and 2foldchange to 2 and see what will happen with my plots.

I will try to change all my ensemble id to hugo id.

I have faced a problem with the heatmap error. Everytime I try to put the reference of "annotation_col=df" into my code, it will not work.
